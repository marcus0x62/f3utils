# f3utils

F3utils provides a couple of convenience features that my [home F3 region](https://f3franklin.com) uses: a MySQL-to-AJAX
adapter to display our Q Calendar automatically on our website and the FNGBot, which is a Slack bot that we use to process
new members. It can automatically invite someone to Slack, add them to our mailing list, and post a message in a Slack
channel that our welcome team uses to track new members.

The Q Calendar interface is fairly universal to any region using Q Signups; the FNG Bot would require some adaptation for
another region to use. If you're from another F3 region and you want to use my endpoint to pull your Q calendar entries,
send me an [email](mailto:marcusb@marcusb.org) and I'll get you the pertinent info.
